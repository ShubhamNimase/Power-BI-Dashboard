  <h1> Power BI dashboard on superstore sales dataset </h1> 
 
<P> üìù <i>I've created this dashboard by using Power BI which can help superstore owner draw powerful insights about the sales in the store. I also tried to forecast the sales for next few days.
 <br> üí° <b>Tip:- </b> The forecast may not be accurate, it is just to show feature of Power BI.</i></P>

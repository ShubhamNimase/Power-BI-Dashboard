## Power BI dashboard on superstore sales dataset
 
üìù _I've created this dashboard by using Power BI which can help superstore owner draw powerful insights about the sales in the store. I also tried to forecast the sales for next few days. üí° **Tip:** The forecast may not be accurate, it is just to show feature of Power BI._
